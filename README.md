In this ASP.NET Core MVC application, we have implemented a robust authentication and authorization system.
This system encompasses both permission-based authorization and configurable self-user registration along with organization setup capabilities.

Authentication and Authorization:

This ASP.NET Core MVC application ensures secure user access through a well-structured authentication and authorization mechanism.
Permission-Based Authorization:

Access to various application features and resources is finely controlled through permission-based authorization. Users are granted specific permissions that dictate what actions they can perform within the application.
Configurable Self-User Registration:

I have implemented a flexible self-user registration process. This allows individuals to register themselves as users within the application. Users can create their accounts, set their own credentials, and start using the platform with minimal administrative intervention.
Organization Setups:

This application goes a step further by supporting organization setups. It means that users can create or join organizations within the platform. Each organization can have its own specific permissions and configuration, making it suitable for diverse use cases, such as team collaboration or managing different entities.
In summary, our ASP.NET Core MVC application provides a comprehensive authentication and authorization framework that ensures secure access control. It includes permission-based authorization, user self-registration, and support for organization setups, making it versatile and adaptable to various scenarios and user requirements.
